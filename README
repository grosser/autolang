= Autolang
 
== Goal

Translate all your Gettext - msgids to another language using google-translate.

== Usage

L=es rake autolang:translate #to translate into spanish (=es)
 
 
== TODO

Any help is appreciated.  This currently works well-enough for us but can be expanded to be much smarter.

Fix the @cook_string@ and @reconstitute_string@ methods to handle strings like: _Application|Close_ and _ThisIsMyCamelCasedString_.  Currently the Google Translate engine will not translate camel cased strings and only grabs the first part of a pipe separated string.
